#+title: org-inbox-modeline-counter

* Purpose

The org-inbox-modeline-counter is an Emacs package that displays the count of first-level headings in an Org-mode file in the mode-line. This can be useful for tracking the number of items in a to-do list or inbox-style Org file, providing real-time updates as the file is modified.

* How it works

This package watches a specified Org file for changes and counts the number of first-level headings (i.e., headings starting with a single asterisk `*`). The count is displayed in the Emacs mode-line, and it is updated automatically when the file changes.

The package uses Emacs' `filenotify` library to monitor the file for any changes (such as edits) and updates the mode-line count accordingly.

* Dependencies

- Emacs 24.3 or higher
- `filenotify` library (usually available in modern Emacs installations)

* Configuration

1. Set the path of the Org file to be monitored by setting the variable `org-inbox-modeline-counter-watch-file`:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-inbox-modeline-counter-watch-file "/path/to/your/inbox.org")
#+end_src

2. Enable the minor mode org-inbox-modeline-counter-mode to start watching the file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-inbox-modeline-counter-mode 1)
#+end_src

Once the mode is enabled, the item count will appear in the mode-line and will be updated whenever the watched file changes.

3. (Optionally) Specify a custom text to display when hovering the counter

This customizable variable allows you to modify the text that will appear in the mode-line tooltip (when hovering over the item count) alongside the number of first-level headings. By default, it displays: "items in GTD inbox."

You can change this text to suit your needs. For example, if you’re using this for a different purpose, you could modify the string like so:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-inbox-modeline-counter-help-echo-text "tasks in your to-do list.")
#+end_src

With this change, the help-echo text will now display something like “5 tasks in your to-do list.” when you hover over the item count in the mode-line.
